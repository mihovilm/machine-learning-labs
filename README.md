# machine-learning-labs
Labs for my machine learning class. Using scikit-learn, python, pandas, and Jupyter Notebook.

Usually each folder has a different .csv file with a couple features, and the benchmark for model accuracy was about 65-70% for each. 
The Notebook files contain my attempts at beating those benchmarks.
